            <p>It is an open sandbox video game, developed by the Scottish company Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design) and published by Rockstar Games in October 1997 for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. It is the first video game in the Grand Theft Auto series. The gameplay consists of a combination of action, adventure, driving, and the occasional role-playing mode, with elements of stealth and racing, and has generated controversy for its adult nature and violent undertones.</p>

            <p>The character played by the player is Claude Speed, also the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto III. The video game is set in a retro-futuristic city called Anywhere City, in the year 1999, with three areas. The objective in each of the three areas is to obtain enough money to escape and move on to the next one. The saga's freedom of action is still evident in this game, since in order to achieve the objective, you can perform any task that gives money.</p>
